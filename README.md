# Path Optimization Simulation

An extension of [this](https://github.com/WilliamZhang20/ros-task) repository, but now with simulation of more complex dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithms.

Whereas [this](https://github.com/WilliamZhang20/Robot_Navigation_Wato) from the WATOnomous design team implemented control algorithms on a ragdoll box robot with fake physics and a fake appearance, we are operating in this repository on a **physical model** of [this](https://docs.trossenrobotics.com/agilex_limo_docs/) robot, of which a real one is used in the UWaterloo CL2 Lab.

Branches will experiment with:

1. Timed Elastic Band (TEB) - currently in main, hard to tune, investigating Multi-Objective Solving
2. Regulated Pure Pursuit (RPP) - in the `pure_pursuit` branch

Both of the above are local planners running at high frequency, take the path points generated by a global planner (e.g. A*) running at low frequency, then generate velocity points publishing to the `/cmd_vel` ROS2 topic.

## How to Run

### Build the simulator

```bash
./scripts/build/sim.sh
```

### Run the simulator

```bash
./scripts/deploy/devel.sh # To enter the docker container
ros2 launch limo_simulation limo.launch.py # To launch the simulator
```

### Publish to /goal_point to make the robot move

In the future, integration with a visualizer like Foxglove will be finished.

```bash
ros2 topic pub /goal_point geometry_msgs/msg/PointStamped "

  stamp:
    sec: 0
    nanosec: 0
  frame_id: 'map'
point:
